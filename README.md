Seed dataset

This Program is About Principle Component analysis of Seed dataset for clustering visualization.

I have used Jupyter console.

Along with Clustering Visualization Accuracy using Classifiers Such as Logistic regression, KNN, Support vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision tree and Random forest Classifier is provided. To know the exactness in Accuracy Cohen Kappa is used.
